            <h2>First Mystery: <span class="text-giallo">Mary, woman of listening</span></h2>
          </div>
          <h4 class="text-giallo ff-sub">Luke 1,26-28</h4>
          <p><em>In the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a city of Galilee named Nazareth, to a virgin betrothed to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David. And the virgin's name was Mary. And he came to her and said, "Greetings, O favored one, the Lord is with you!"</em></p>
          <h4 class="text-giallo ff-sub">Commentary</h4>
          <p>The first snapshot that the Gospel offers us of Mary is of a girl listening to an angel, tracing the first step for those who want to enter into a true relationship with others: the art of listening. It shows us how to make space in our lives for the entrance of light.</p>
          <p>Those who know how to create an oasis of listening make space for light. Much silence is needed to listen to God's amazed silence. God can enter because he finds emptiness. In the face of wind and sun, the best the air can do is to be transparent.</p>
          <p>In the face of the Spirit, the best the soul can do is to be poor. A splendid image describes the humility of the Lord's handmaid as an hourglass that empties itself with joy. The joy of poverty comes from a certainty: the hourglass knows that soon, suddenly, a hand will turn it over.</p>
          <h4 class="text-giallo ff-sub">Mothers</h4>
          <p>Of mothers like Mary, we know two things: they have love and a home. Their life cries out to us something beautiful: we can do without many things, we can be poor in everything, but to live we need love, much love. Keep the flame of love burning in them, even when weariness shows in their eyes and the heart feels heavy.</p>

            <h2>Second Mystery: <span class="text-giallo">Mary, wife of Joseph</span></h2>
          </div>
          <h4 class="text-giallo ff-sub">Matthew 1,18-25</h4>
          <p><em>Now the birth of Jesus Christ took place in this way. When his mother Mary had been betrothed to Joseph, before they came together she was found to be with child from the Holy Spirit. And her husband Joseph, being a just man and unwilling to put her to shame, resolved to divorce her quietly. But as he considered these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, "Joseph, son of David, do not fear to take Mary as your wife, for that which is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit. She will bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins."<br>
          All this took place to fulfill what the Lord had spoken by the prophet: "Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and they shall call his name Immanuel" (which means, God with us). When Joseph woke from sleep, he did as the angel of the Lord commanded him: he took his wife, but knew her not until she had given birth to a son. And he called his name Jesus.</em></p>
          <h4 class="text-giallo ff-sub">Commentary</h4>
          <p>Joseph is the man in love. He is the man of dreams. The carpenter is also the dreamer, hands hardened by work and heart softened by love and dreams. After doubts and dreams, after angels and trepidations, after a hard trial, Joseph "took her with him." Mary enters the dreamer's house, leaves her father's house to entrust herself to another, in a journey of communion that will lead her to build a new home, a common destiny. Generating a child is easy, but being father and mother to him, loving him, making him grow, making him happy, teaching him the craft of being human, this is quite another adventure. It takes only a few moments to become a parent, but fathers and mothers become so throughout their entire lives.</p>
          <h4 class="text-giallo ff-sub">Fathers</h4>
          <p>Joseph, help us to live like you the primacy of love. To not fear great things, to welcome not the words that come from our fears but those that come from God, to put them into practice, to dream. When one dreams alone, this is an illusion; when one dreams with God, reality begins.</p>

          </div>
          <h4 class="text-giallo ff-sub">Matthew 2,9-11</h4>
          <p><em>After listening to the king, they went on their way. And behold, the star that they had seen when it rose went before them until it came to rest over the place where the child was. When they saw the star, they rejoiced exceedingly with great joy. And going into the house they saw the child with Mary his mother, and they fell down and worshiped him. Then, opening their treasures, they offered him gifts, gold and frankincense and myrrh.</em></p>
          <h4 class="text-giallo ff-sub">Commentary</h4>
          <p>Bethlehem, house of bread - in Hebrew - , and of silence. No one speaks in the Gospel account. There is only a play of glances. Mary looks and does not speak, she keeps everything in the silence of her heart. The magi see the child with his mother and worship, a verb that etymologically means to bring the hand to the mouth and to be silent and contemplate. God becomes a child. He is a God who does not impose himself, who has needs. Even the reality of God now tastes of bread. Opening their treasures, they offered gold, frankincense and myrrh. There is no worship without a gift. When you have met a person, when someone is pleasing to you, dear, loved and loving, sooner or later you feel the need to offer a gift, to enter into the dimension of the gift, into love that gives, not into love that takes.</p>
          <h4 class="text-giallo ff-sub">Spiritual assistants</h4>
          <p>Humility is the revolutionary word of Jesus' birth. O Magi, wise seekers of light, students of the stars, masters of life, make us understand: after a long journey, full of unexpected events and false navigators, did you prostrate yourselves, did you make yourselves small before the infinitely small?</p>
          <p>Make us learn to love the humanity of Christ in the little ones of our communities. We ask you for our spiritual assistants the beauty of Christ. Human and divine: man of the streets and friend of publicans, his hands on the sick and his eyes in the eyes of travelers, seeking the lost sheep and embracing the prodigal son. An embrace that gives life.</p>

          </div>
          <h4 class="text-giallo ff-sub">Luke 2,39-52</h4>
          <p><em>And when they had performed everything according to the Law of the Lord, they returned into Galilee, to their own town of Nazareth. And the child grew and became strong, filled with wisdom. And the favor of God was upon him. Now his parents went to Jerusalem every year at the Feast of the Passover. And when he was twelve years old, they went up according to custom. And when the feast was ended, as they were returning, the boy Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem. His parents did not know it, but supposing him to be in the group they went a day's journey, but then they began to search for him among their relatives and acquaintances, and when they did not find him, they returned to Jerusalem, searching for him. After three days they found him in the temple, sitting among the teachers, listening to them and asking them questions. And all who heard him were amazed at his understanding and his answers. And when his parents saw him, they were astonished. And his mother said to him, "Son, why have you treated us so? Behold, your father and I have been searching for you in great distress." And he said to them, "Why were you looking for me? Did you not know that I must be in my Father's house?" And they did not understand the saying that he spoke to them. And he went down with them and came to Nazareth and was submissive to them. And his mother treasured up all these things in her heart. And Jesus increased in wisdom and in stature and in favor with God and man.</em></p>
          <h4 class="text-giallo ff-sub">Commentary</h4>
          <p>The trial is the form with which God educates man's desire and freedom. He leads him out of voracious desire to open him to being a freedom that trusts the other and entrusts itself to God. The trial makes the heart wise. "Why were you looking for me? Did you not know that I must be about my Father's business?" But they did not understand the saying that he spoke to them. "And he went down with them and came to Nazareth and was submissive to them." This should beat in the heart of every family: to be concerned with the things of God and then to care for the people entrusted to us. Jesus leaves the temple and the doctors and goes with Mary and Joseph who are masters of life; he leaves those who interpret books and goes with those who interpret the secret of life. House of Nazareth, blessed house, house where one speaks to the heart: love under every silence, hope under every fear, the poetry of daily gestures, the simple eyes of things, the moment that fades into eternity and eternity that germinates in every moment. Home: where it is possible to find God in gestures.</p>
          <h4 class="text-giallo ff-sub">Friends</h4>
          <p>Friends in Faith and Light cannot be missing. House built on rock, root planted in good soil and journey with a direction and a destination. A good community, a humanly beautiful life, because in it there is room for friendship, encounter with others, festive table, dance, attentive closeness, rest, shared joy, the ability to praise, wonder. A light that infects Peter who stammers: "It is good for us to be here, with you, with your friends."</p>

            <h2>Fifth Mystery: <span class="text-giallo">Mary, woman of new wine</span></h2>
          </div>  
          <h4 class="text-giallo ff-sub">John 2,1-11</h4>
          <p><em>On the third day there was a wedding at Cana in Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was there. Jesus also was invited to the wedding with his disciples. When the wine ran out, the mother of Jesus said to him, "They have no wine." And Jesus said to her, "Woman, what does this have to do with me? My hour has not yet come." His mother said to the servants, "Do whatever he tells you." Now there were six stone water jars there for the Jewish rites of purification, each holding twenty or thirty gallons. Jesus said to the servants, "Fill the jars with water." And they filled them up to the brim. And he said to them, "Now draw some out and take it to the master of the feast." So they took it. When the master of the feast tasted the water now become wine, and did not know where it came from (though the servants who had drawn the water knew), the master of the feast called the bridegroom and said to him, "Everyone serves the good wine first, and when people have drunk freely, then the poor wine. But you have kept the good wine until now." This, the first of his signs, Jesus did at Cana in Galilee, and manifested his glory. And his disciples believed in him.</em></p>
          <h4 class="text-giallo ff-sub">Commentary</h4>
          <p>Jesus begins his mission by participating in a wedding banquet. Jesus goes to a feast, a feast of love to tell us something great: that from a house where there is love, from a family, from a community that begins by betting on love and fidelity comes the true miraculous force to change life. Wine is the symbol of love: love runs out and this is the daily, universal experience, because Cana is the perennial story of each of us. Mary notices it first, because she knows love better than anyone, because she is imbued with it. Mary feels that every crisis and every feast concerns her, but above all that every person concerns her, and she expresses this to her son: "They have no wine," them, the spouses. She does not say, in fact: "There is no more wine," in its impersonal form. But she shows that her deep attention goes to the two spouses who are about to be humiliated on their most beautiful day. She seems to say: first people, then things. And in doing so, Mary now teaches us reconciliation with attention; to intercede; to involve; to do. "Do whatever he tells you" are Mary's last words in the Gospel, then she disappears behind her son's words, she will speak no more. They are her testament, and like every testament they must be the most precious law for children, for every child.</p>
          <h4 class="text-giallo ff-sub">People with disabilities</h4>
          <p>But what can we bring to the Lord? Like the servants of Cana, only water, nothing but water. Yet he wants it all and wants exactly that. And when our stone jars of our humanity are offered to him full of poverty and fragility, full of our humanity, he will be the one to transform this simple water into the best of wines. We believe in God, because he is the God of Cana, a happy God who loves the happiness of his children and loves the feast.</p>

Not one word has failed of all his good promise, which he spoke by Moses his servant. The Lord our God be with us, as he was with our fathers. May he not leave us or forsake us, that he may incline our hearts to him, to walk in all his ways and to keep his commandments, his statutes, and his rules, which he commanded our fathers. Let these words of mine, with which I have pleaded before the Lord, be near to the Lord our God day and night, and may he maintain the cause of his servant and the cause of his people Israel, as each day requires, that all the peoples of the earth may know that the Lord is God; there is no other.
