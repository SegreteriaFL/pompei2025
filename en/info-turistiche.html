  <h2>The Sanctuary of Pompeii</h2>
  
  <section class="entry programma slot">
    <h3>The Sanctuary of Pompeii and the Painting of the Virgin</h3>
    <p>The Sanctuary of the Blessed Virgin of the Holy Rosary is one of the most visited Marian sanctuaries in Italy and has been a pontifical basilica since 1901. Its history is linked to the Blessed Bartolo Longo, co-founder with his wife Marianna Farnararo de Fusco.</p>
    <p>Construction began on May 8, 1876, thanks to the collection of an offering of one soldo per month. Latin cross plan, it initially had only one nave. The bell tower was completed in 1925. Between 1934 and 1939, it was expanded to three naves. It survived the 1944 eruption of Vesuvius and the arrival of the Nazis.</p>
    <p>On May 8 and the first Sunday of October, tens of thousands of faithful gather for the Supplica to the Madonna, broadcast also on radio and TV. Since 2018, the bedroom and study of the Blessed Longo can be visited in the Sanctuary's Offerings Room.</p>
    <p><strong>The icon of the Madonna of Pompeii</strong> depicts the Virgin enthroned with Jesus in her arms. Jesus and Mary offer the Rosary to St. Dominic and St. Catherine of Siena. The bronze frame encloses the 20 mysteries of the Rosary, including the luminous ones. The image was transported in 1875 on a manure cart and restored in 1876.</p>

    <h3>The Supplica to the Virgin of the Rosary of Pompeii</h3>
    <p>Composed by the Blessed Bartolo Longo in 1883, the Supplica is a solemn and communal prayer addressed to the Virgin Mary, Queen of the Holy Rosary of Pompeii. It is officially recited on <strong>May 8</strong> and the <strong>first Sunday of October</strong>, but can be prayed at any time, especially in difficult moments.</p>
    <p>It is a poetic and vibrant prayer that invokes the Madonna's protection against natural, moral, and spiritual calamities. It has become one of the most participated moments of popular Italian devotion.</p>
    <p>The text alternates ardent supplications, acts of trust and repentance, meditations on the mysteries of salvation, and requests for grace for the entire world. Each phrase is accompanied by the title "Queen of the Rosary of Pompeii, pray for us".</p>
    <p>The culminating moment is the <strong>"cry of the supplication"</strong>, which rises from Pompeii and symbolically reaches all the sanctuaries of the world:</p>
    <blockquote class="citazione">
      <p>"Turn, O Mary, your merciful gaze upon us, upon our families, upon Italy, upon the world"</p>

    <h3>Prayer of Faith and Light before the Icon of the Virgin</h3>
    <p>This prayer was composed for the pilgrimage and can be recited before the icon of the Madonna of Pompeii, alone or in community. It is an act of entrustment, praise, and intercession that expresses the heart of Faith and Light.</p>
    <blockquote class="citazione">
      <p>Mary, our Mother,

        we have come from every part of Italy

        to meet you in Pompeii,</p>
      <p>to gaze upon your kind face,

        to place ourselves under your mantle,

        to entrust to you our families

        and our communities,

        people with disabilities

        and their parents, brothers, and friends.</p>
      <p>As at Cana, you see every lack,

        every anxiety,

        every wounded heart.

        You invite us to do what your Son says.

        Help us to do his will,

        to become his disciples.</p>
      <p>Mother of silence and listening,

        Mother of tenderness and trust,

        teach us the beauty of shared life,

        of friendship, of embrace,

        of celebration that excludes no one.</p>
      <p>We are here, O Mary,

        pilgrims and grateful,

        and we pray to you:

        stay with us and lead us to Jesus.</p>

  <h2>Archaeological Park</h2>
  
  <section class="entry programma slot">
    <h3>A unique archaeological park in the world</h3>
    <p>What makes Pompeii famous in the world is a truly unique archaeological site: an entire city that emerges little by little, as excavations free houses, squares, theaters, and shops from the layer of lava that covered everything on a terrible day in 79 AD. Discoveries continue, archaeologists are constantly at work, but already many buildings have returned to their original appearance. Exploring ancient Pompeii is an adventure not to be missed!</p>
  </section>

  <section class="entry programma slot">
    <h3>Pompeii: a rich city dedicated to trade</h3>
    <p>In 79 AD, Pompeii was one of the most beautiful and flourishing cities on the Gulf of Naples. It had large palaces, temples, houses full of colorful frescoes, markets, and shops of every type. Close to the sea, it had developed a rich economic life and trade that reached the most distant regions of the Roman Empire.</p>
    <p>Its products were mainly wine and oil: the land was very fertile, the soil rich in volcanic material from the volcano that overlooked the city, Vesuvius. At that time, it was thought to be a mountain like others, covered in grass. The volcano had never revealed itself before. And Pompeii had an 800-year history.</p>
    <p>Its founders were the Oscans, an Italic population widespread in Campania, Abruzzo, and Umbria before the Roman conquest. The Oscans founded 5 cities on the Gulf of Naples. According to historians, Pompeii means precisely "five" in the Oscan language.</p>
    <p>Thanks to its position on a natural bay, Pompeii established itself as an important commercial city. It was occupied by Greeks, Etruscans, and Samnites until the arrival of the Romans who conquered it in the 2nd century BC. Thus, elements of Greek, Etruscan, and Samnite architecture mixed with Roman canons, whose noble families preferred Pompeii as a vacation spot.</p>
    <p>That period dates back to the Forum, the Basilica where the tribunal was located, the Temple of Jupiter, the House of the Faun, one of the largest private houses.</p>
    <p>The eruption of the year 79 caught the inhabitants by surprise: they were not prepared to escape. They did not know how to read the signs that the "mountain" was sending.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="entry programma slot">
    <h3>Pliny the Younger</h3>
    <p>On the evening of October 24, 79, a very high column of smoke rose from Vesuvius and the gases, including sulfur, spread over Pompeii, Herculaneum, Stabiae. The earth began to shake and then there was a huge explosion of lava and debris that covered all the inhabited centers.</p>
    <p>To observe and then recount everything was the Latin writer Pliny the Younger, who with his uncle Pliny the Elder was on board a Roman ship anchored in the Gulf of Naples.</p>
    <p>Herculaneum and Stabiae were hit first by the toxic cloud and then by lava flows. Some people tried to flee to the sea and Pliny the Elder died while helping those trying to reach his ship. The nephew reported everything to the historian Tacitus, passing down the story of the eruption in one of his letters.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="entry programma slot">
    <h3>The terrible eruption</h3>
    <p>The day after Herculaneum, it was Pompeii's turn. The inhabitants thought it was all over the previous evening. They were still in their homes. They continued their lives. Instead, the city was overwhelmed by a sort of fireball that covered houses, streets, people. Everyone was like frozen in the position they had at the moment they were covered in incandescent ash and thus they were found many centuries later. There were those sleeping, hiding, running...</p>
    <p>The casts of solidified lava have allowed a sort of three-dimensional photograph of those terrible moments to reach our days. And much of the buildings have also been preserved. Archaeologists, year after year, are bringing back to light the ancient splendors.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="entry programma slot">
    <h3>The archaeological discoveries</h3>
    <p>Pompeii remained buried in the ashes spewed by Vesuvius until the 18th century. Excavations began in 1738 in Herculaneum and in 1748 in Pompeii: a nearly intact city emerged with markets, temples, houses full of frescoes. Excavations continue and help discover how the Pompeians lived, what they ate, what trades they practiced. A precious discovery concerns the Thermopolium, a kind of fast-food place where food was stored in large terracotta amphorae embedded in the counter.</p>
    <p>The layer of lava that covered the city allowed the recovery of a vast quantity of perfectly preserved biological remains: on the organic finds, scholars have applied modern scientific techniques to precisely reconstruct the diet of the Pompeian population, as well as the agricultural and livestock practices of the time.</p>
    <p>Accurate studies reveal a variety of diets for pigs, sheep, and goats, corresponding to different forms of breeding probably linked to specific economic or family contexts. Regarding people, the analysis confirmed the central role of cereals and legumes in the daily diet of the Pompeians: vegetables were grown locally. Fish, mollusks, and other sea products also constituted an important part of the local diet: research suggests not only frequent consumption of these foods but also a true intensive exploitation of aquatic resources.</p>
    <p>Today the Archaeological Park of Pompeii, established in 2016, is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It includes not only the excavations of Pompeii but also the villas of Oplontis, Stabiae, and Boscoreale. The site extends over about 66 hectares, of which over 50 have been excavated. It is possible to visit the Forum, the Baths, the Amphitheater, the House of the Faun, the Villa of the Mysteries, and numerous shops, bakeries, and frescoed domus.</p>
    <p>Visits are accessible to all, thanks to facilitated paths (Pompeii for all) and digital supports like the interactive map and the official Park app.</p>

<!-- Small Path -->
<section class="section-group" id="percorso-small">
  <h2>Small Path</h2>
  
  <section class="entry programma slot">
    <h3>Small Path</h3>
    <p>Dedicated to those who struggle to walk and face long displacements, the Small Path includes the first buildings near the Amphitheater Gate: by admiring these spaces, one can understand how life was in ancient Pompeii and admire precious buildings. An exhibition in the Great Palestra is of great help in knowing the lifestyle of the Pompeians.</p>
    
    <h4>Amphitheater</h4>
    <p>It is the first building found entering from the Amphitheater Gate, which gives it its name. It is the oldest among those known in the Roman world. Built in 70 BC on the initiative of the magistrates Caius Quinctius Valgus and Marcus Porcius, it could accommodate up to 20,000 spectators from not only Pompeii but also neighboring cities. It is located in a peripheral area precisely to facilitate the movement of such a large number of people. External staircases with double ramps provide access to the upper tiers, a descending corridor ensures access to the lower tiers. The arena is separated from the space for spectators by a parapet, frescoed with gladiatorial subject paintings, in whose upper part inscriptions with the names of the magistrates who had the tiers built are still readable.</p>
    <p>In 59 AD, the enthusiasm of the spectators degenerated into a bloody brawl between Pompeians and Nucerians. Following these disorders, the Roman Senate decided to close the Pompeii arena for ten years, but the measure was revoked in 62 AD, after the disastrous earthquake that struck the city. The first excavations date back to 1748, continued in 1813-1814.</p>

    <h4>The Great Palestra</h4>
    <p>The "Great Palestra" consists of a large open square courtyard, about 140 x 140 meters, surrounded by porticoes and closed externally by a high crenellated wall in which 10 doors open. On three sides of the large inner courtyard were planted plane trees, centenarian at the time of the eruption, of which the casts of the roots are now visible; in the center is a 23 x 35 meter pool. It was built in the Augustan age, at the beginning of the 1st century AD; it was the place intended for the physical and intellectual training of young citizens. Numerous graffiti of erotic or poetic theme left by frequenters are present on the walls and columns. During the excavation, numerous victims were found who had vainly sought refuge or a way of escape through the building. The Palestra hosts the permanent exhibition of large frescoes and finds from the Moregine Triclini Complex, a refined building located about 600 meters from the Pompeii site, near the river port. Excavation date: 1935-1939.</p>

    <h4>Being a Woman in Ancient Pompeii</h4>
    <p>Frescoes, private and funerary portraits, graffiti, inscriptions, and everyday objects offer us precious information on the life and activities of a female universe fundamental to the good functioning of the community. All female categories are documented: matrons, freedwomen, slaves; all family roles: wives, daughters, concubines; all phases of life: birth, childhood, marriage, maternity, death.</p>
    <p>This composite and multifaceted female world is dedicated to the exhibition "Being a Woman in Ancient Pompeii", currently at the Great Palestra of Pompeii.</p>
    <p>Women in Pompeii performed a variety of roles, activities, and had habits that can be reconstructed thanks to archaeological discoveries.</p>

    <h5>Role</h5>
    <p>High-ranking matrons could use ceremonial chariots, like the four-wheeled pilentum found at Civita Giuliana, for ceremonies. This type of chariot was also used by priestesses and vestals, and by young girls for weddings.</p>
    <p>In Roman society, and therefore in Pompeii, marriage was a fundamental aspect, as evidenced by the mention of social transformations that also concerned marriage.</p>
    <p>In Pompeii, Athena was seen as a protective divinity linked to the regeneration of the civic body through the normative passage of the girl to wife.</p>
    <p>Wealthy women could have a slave (ornatrix) tasked with helping them apply makeup.</p>

    <h5>Activities</h5>
    <p>Women, though more rarely than men, could engage in physical activities, gymnastics, and games in the gymnasiums attached to the thermal complexes.</p>
    <p>In the houses, women presumably dedicated themselves to daily activities, as suggested by the finding of terracotta tableware used for such purposes.</p>
    <p>Women loved to adorn themselves very much.</p>
    <p>Roman women used fake hair and hair dyes, preferring the blonde color.</p>
    <p>Childbirth was a very delicate moment in women's lives, with high infant mortality and risk of death for mothers.</p>
    <p>Women cared about body care and frequented public and private thermal complexes.</p>
    <p>Some sources mention the role of women in Pompeii's municipal elections, suggesting their participation, albeit perhaps limited, in political life.</p>
    <p>Women carried jewelry (rings, necklaces, bracelets, earrings, and gems) with them in the attempt to flee the eruption, both as a form of wealth and for affection.</p>

    <h5>Habits</h5>
    <p>Women cared a lot about body care, as demonstrated by the frequency of thermal complexes.</p>
    <p>The use of oil mixed with scented extracts or oil and very fine sand for cleansing was a common practice. The oil and sand were then removed with strigils.</p>
    <p>Women loved to use cosmetics to improve their appearance.</p>
    <p>They wore jewelry, which in Pompeian society was characterized by a rather plastic relief rather than great finesse of execution.</p>
    <p>Habits related to the home and way of living were significantly different from modern ones.</p>
    <p>Women could frequent the baths.</p>
    <p>High-ranking women could own and frequent luxury villas.</p>
    <p>It is important to note that knowledge of women's lives in Pompeii is often mediated by archaeological discoveries and scholars' interpretations. However, the finds and pictorial and other testimonies offer a significant glimpse into their roles, activities, and habits in Pompeian society.</p>

    <h4>Praedia of Julia Felix</h4>
    <p>Julia Felix was the owner of a large complex (the so-called Praedia) consisting of a domus, a large garden on which a series of residential spaces open, a thermal plant, and a vast park. The occupation of the insula began in the 2nd century BC, but the profound building renewal by Julia Felix dates back to the mid-1st century BC. It was she who transformed this residence into a source of income.</p>
    <p>Julia's father, Spurio, was not noble but very skilled in business. It was he who created the house then left in inheritance to his daughter, a few steps from the amphitheater.</p>
    <p>Following the terrible earthquake of 62 AD, in Pompeii there were no more spaces to spend moments of relaxation and body care, because the Stabian Baths were under restoration and the new Central Baths were still under construction. Julia thought to expand and open her splendid bathing rooms to the public, thus ensuring herself a good income. The rental notice was written in large letters on the wall near the entrance, in red, to be seen from afar: today it is preserved in the National Archaeological Museum of Naples.</p>
    <p>The thermal plant, in particular, from private became public: from the entrance open at civic number 6, one accessed the porticoed courtyard that served as a waiting room, followed by the frigidarium, the tepidarium with suspensurae floor, the circular laconicum, and the calidarium with apse on the southern side. Furthermore, Julia rented the tabernae equipped with counters on Via dell'Abbondanza.</p>
    <p>The spaces are decorated. The summer triclinium stands out, a sort of grotto with water games around the convivial beds, open onto the portico marked by marble pillars. The house was one of the first to be excavated in the years 1754-1757; 1912; 1933-1934; buried and brought to light in 1951-1952.</p>

  <h2>Medium Path</h2>
  
  <section class="entry programma slot">
    <p>In addition to the Small Path, the Medium Path adds two buildings, reachable by following paths accessible to wheelchairs, which further clarify how life was in ancient Pompeii.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="entry programma slot">
    <h3>House of Menander</h3>
    <p>The last owner of this grandiose dwelling was the freedman Quintus Poppaeus, aedile in office around 40 AD. Member of a family that boasted ties with Poppea Augusta, Nero's second wife. The dwelling was named "of Menander" for the portrait of this poet found at the bottom of the peristyle, i.e., the courtyard surrounded by porticoes.</p>
    <p>Along the facade of the building there are low masonry seats for the clientele (clientes) and the entrance is framed by two Corinthian pillars. The large rectangular impluvium in the atrium is lined with marble. On the walls appear frescoed medallions with the head of Zeus-Ammon and small panels with tragic masks. Next to the entrance are the monumental shrine of the Lares (the protective spirits of deceased ancestors), with two pediments and an angular columnette, and the casts of the wooden transoms that closed it.</p>
    <p>In the left wing of the atrium there are red walls bipartitioned vertically, in the center of which figure the scenes of the fall of Troy: on the right Laocoon and his sons strangled by serpents; on the left wall Cassandra opposes the abduction by Ulysses under the eyes of old Priam. On the back wall Cassandra vainly opposes the introduction of the wooden horse, full of Greek warriors, into the city.</p>
    <p>The back side is occupied by a tablinum (room designed to receive guests), flanked by two corridors of access to the peristyle that encloses a large garden with low decorated frames inserted between the columns. The outer faces are decorated with groups of animals, while the column shafts are painted with ivy and oleander clumps.</p>
    <p>In the North-West corner of the peristyle (the courtyard surrounded by porticoes) opens the hall with green background walls, decorated with very fine workmanship in vertical black stripes with arabesques; with cupids and medallions with portraits surrounded by sphinxes and vines. The red frieze humorously recounts the wedding of Hippodamia with Pirithous, king of the Lapiths in Thessaly: the centaurs, heated by wine, abduct the bride while the Lapith women remain immobile.</p>
    <p>On the floor (older) is a mosaic depicting the delights of life on the Nile, with porticoed villas, palm trees, and cypresses on the banks, and a ship with pygmies. On the threshold of the entrance to the calidarium, a servant carries two vessels, one for oil, the other for perfume.</p>
    <p>In the mosaic floor swim fish, dolphins, a crab, a character with the sexual organ highlighted, and another hunting a monster with the trident. In the wall paintings we see groups of wrestlers, allusion to the gymnastic exercises that accompany the bathing practice.</p>
    <p>On the West side of the atrium is a terrace with a large exedra (room in the shape of a hemicycle) used as a solarium. Below the thermal sector are the underground rooms where a chest with a treasure of 118 pieces of silverware weighing 24 kg was found, while a casket contained gold jewelry and 1432 sesterces. A medium-large treasure: the availability of liquid money of rich Pompeian families ranged between 1,000 and 3,000 sesterces.</p>
    <p>The South side of the courtyard features a series of rectangular and semicircular exedrae and a cubiculum. In the first exedra from the right, there is a small niche with an altar for domestic worship. The five sculptures in wax or wood, deposited there, left imprints in the hardened ash bench, and plaster casts could thus be made; they are the only images of ancestors recovered in Pompeii. They were carried in procession on the occasion of public sacrifices and family funerals.</p>
    <p>In the third exedra is the portrait of the playwright Menander, while on the other walls there are tragic and satirical masks.</p>
    <p>On the East side walls with yellow background painted with Dionysian motifs. The adjacent triclinium (dining room) is the largest in Pompeii, about 8 meters high with a surface of 87.5 square meters, features on high on one wall a large window with pediment.</p>
    <p>To the servants' quarter one descends by a ramp: one of the amphorae found there contained honey, others Sorrento wine, another vinegar. To the right is the stable with the carriage shed. In this space the skeleton of the guard dog was found.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="entry programma slot">
    <h3>The House of the Ship Europa</h3>
    <p>The domus owes its name to the large graffiti incised on the north wall of the peristyle, where a large cargo ship, called "Europa", is depicted, flanked by other minor vessels.</p>
    <p>The house, whose original core dates back to the 3rd century BC, had a complex building history of numerous modifications and expansions; in its current form, it features a wide peristyle with numerous rooms arranged in succession on the northern and western sides. The monumental tuff columns and decorations of some rooms preserve the memory of the oldest building phases and the moments of greatest splendor of the domus.</p>
    <p>Of particular value is the decoration in the cubiculum adjacent to the entrance, where the fake colored marble block lining, typical of this decorative style, is enriched by the presence, in the upper part of the wall, of Ionic half-columns also made in stucco.</p>
    <p>In the last phase of the city's life, the domus probably hosted an agricultural production activity; the rear sector of the house was, in fact, occupied by a large green space on two levels.</p>
    <p>As happened in other domus, an original dwelling was transformed by adapting the rooms to production and commercial activities, in this case agricultural. In the large garden, the cultivation of beans, onions, cabbages, and fruit plants was planted; one room was used as a stable for animals.</p>

<!-- Large Path -->
<section class="section-group" id="percorso-large">
  <h2>Large Path</h2>
  
  <section class="entry programma slot">
    <p>Those who tackle the Large Path can roam freely throughout the archaeological site: we suggest using the site <a href="https://pompeiisites.org/wp-content/uploads/Guida_agli_scavi_di_Pompeii.pdf" class="link esterno" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://pompeiisites.org/wp-content/uploads/Guida_agli_scavi_di_Pompeii.pdf</a> which offers indications on all the buildings encountered. Get a map at the entrance, it will guide you in the movements. The site is very large, you won't be able to see everything in a few hours. We suggest doing the Medium Path and then reaching the Eagle's Cottage, climb to see the archaeologists at work from above. Then, descend (perhaps after a stop at the bar), return to Via dell'Abbondanza and reach the Forum.</p>
    <p>The Civil Forum represented the center of daily life in Pompeii, on which all the main public buildings for the administration of the city and justice, for business management, for commercial activities, like markets, as well as the main places of worship opened. The square originally had the appearance of a simple open area of more or less regular shape, beaten earth, on whose western side the Sanctuary of Apollo opened, while the eastern side featured a row of shops. The Forum was profoundly modified between the 3rd-2nd century BC when the shape of the square was regularized, surrounded by porticoes, and the floor paved with tuff slabs. The axis of the square became the facade of the Temple of Jupiter, aligned with Vesuvius.</p>
    <p>At the beginning of the imperial age the Forum was repaved with travertine slabs; some slabs, no longer in their original position, bear the recess to accommodate the bronze letters belonging to a large inscription. The excavations begun by the will of Maria Carolina of Bourbon immediately made it clear that the area had been explored and deprived of its decorations already in ancient times.</p>
    <p>If you have time left, it's nice to visit the Large Theater, the Small Theater Odeon, the Antiquarium, which is located next to Porta Marina, exactly on the opposite front from Porta Anfiteatro. There are preserved casts, finds, information on Ancient Pompeii: it is the museum of the archaeological site, although most of the finds are preserved in Naples.</p>
